    % Fingerprint biometrics are extensively employed to identify individuals based on their distinct physical characteristics. 
    % This recognition method ensures permanence and distinctiveness, establishing a foundation for non-repudiation. 
    % While current recognition techniques are satisfactory, there is room for improvement by extracting a Region of Interest (ROI) that remains consistent across multiple impressions and exhibits unique distinguishing features.
    % By employing this ROI, computational resources are optimized, resulting in more efficient and faster fingerprint recognition systems.
    % Moreover, this extraction process helps mitigate challenges associated with noise, image quality, and partial acquisition.
    % The extracted ROI also contributes to reducing false acceptance or rejection rates and enhances compatibility and interoperability among different fingerprint recognition systems and databases.
    % Nevertheless, extracting the ROI from a fingerprint image remains a challenging task due to factors such as noise, quality, partial capture, etc.
    % 

    % Biometric-based authentication systems are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives.
    % Among the various biometric modalities, fingerprint is one of the most popular and widely used modalities for personal identification and verification,
    % with applications ranging from access control to identity verification.
    % The uniqueness and permanence of fingerprints have made them a reliable means of identification.
    % %% talk about roi first
    % Extraction of the region of interest (ROI) is an essential component of fingerprint recognition systems, as it contains unique and distinctive fingerprint features that can be used for identification.
    % %% Why ROI
    % However, the process of extracting the ROI from a fingerprint image is a challenging task,
    % as it is often affected by several factors, such as noise, orientation, and variations in fingerprint patterns.

    % \begin{comment}
        
    
    % This work aims to propose and evaluate a novel approach for extracting the region of interest (ROI) from fingerprint images using clustering and segmentation techniques.
    % Specifically, the objectives include:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %       \item A universal feature extraction technique for fingerprint images.
    %       \item Proposing a clustering-based hybrid approach for extracting ROI from fingerprint images.
    %       \item Analyzing the robustness of the proposed approach to noise and variations in fingerprint patterns.
    %       \item Demonstrating the practical application of the proposed approach in biometric applications such as access control and identity verification.
    % \end{enumerate}
    % In contrast to existing literature, which typically involves cropping a region around a reference point after some enhancement, the proposed method systematically analyzes the fingerprint to extract the ROI. 
    % The proposed approach combines the advantages of clustering and segmentation techniques to achieve accurate and efficient ROI extraction.
    % The proposed approach can contribute to the advancement of fingerprint recognition technology and
    % enable more accurate and efficient identification in various applications.

\{Paragraph 4 (Proposed Approach): Overview of the proposed methodology\}
    % In this research paper, we offer a clustering-based hybrid approach for extracting ROI from fingerprint images. 
    % Specifically, the fingerprint image is divided into several regions. 
    % Five statistical features from each segmented region are computed, after which clustering is done based on the extracted parameters, leading to the ROI extraction.

\{Paragraph 5 (Contribution of the work):\}
    % To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on publicly available fingerprint databases.
    % The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and is more efficient than existing methods.
    % Furthermore, the approach is robust to noise and variations in fingerprint patterns, making it suitable for real-world applications. Overall, the proposed clustering-based approach provides an effective solution for the extraction of ROI from fingerprint images,
    % which can be applied in various biometric applications like authentication, verification, indexing and data protection, to name a few.
