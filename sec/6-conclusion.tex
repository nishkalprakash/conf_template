\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\{Novelty of the work\}
    % The proposed method finds an ROI from a fingerprint image using agglomerative clustering, whereas existing methods crop a region from fingerprint images based on the threshold value or use morphological operations.

\{Metionable achievement/breakthrough\}

    % The proposed method is always able to consistently extract the ROI from the fingerprint in a relatively short amount of time.

\{Research application/potential\}

    % This method gives consistent ROI for fingerprints obtained from different scanners/sensors while also being translation and rotation invariant.
    
\{Claims if under some assumption\}
    
\{Limitations of the work\}
    % The proposed method performs better if a core point exists in the fingerprint.
    % The experiment has achieved good results for the three datasets and has successfully extracted a consistent ROI from each fingerprint.
    
\{Future scope or Future work\}
    % The work uses the Sobel filter to extract initial features from the entire fingerprint image. This can be improved by using a different filter or a machine-learning approach. The filter used in this experiment was able to give good matching accuracy. The use of a different clustering approach may also be explored.

    % The proposed method extracts the ROI from a fingerprint image using agglomerative clustering, surpassing existing methods that use threshold values or morphological operations for region cropping. It consistently and efficiently extracts the ROI, regardless of scanner/sensor variations, while maintaining translation and rotation invariance. The experiment successfully extracted the ROI for each fingerprint in the two datasets and achieved notable improvements in fingerprint recognition accuracy: 6.8\% for SPD2010 and 24.4\% for FVC2002. Moreover, the proposed method significantly reduced processing time by 80.75\% for SPD2010 and 59.29\% for FVC2002. To further enhance the method, alternative filters or machine learning approaches can be explored, and different clustering approaches could be investigated.
